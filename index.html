  <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5arRiCXIAMxEVs?format=jpg&name=large" width="200" alt="this is mr.chonkers aka thackery binx">
  <p>okay we're gucci lets go:)</p>

  <p>didnt get to practice much last sesh so im pickin up where i left off, learning about CSS stuff starting with colors, im going to color this paragraph like a lavender or somthing...welp turns out i cant do that yet <strong>bUT</strong> i <em>can</em> turn the whole background color so lemme see</p>
  
  <h2 id="chapter-three" class="heading-shit"> well <em>fuck</em>...sorta</h2>

  <p> so doing it on here is a bit different than how i learned it but i wont disregard the notes i took from it because it does have similarities. First theres a separate section for css and choosing colors on <em>here</em> is based on the <strong>hexadecimal code</strong> (#006A80) not the <strong>decimal code</strong> (rgb (0,0,0)) like in khan. </p>
  <img src="https://cis.msjc.edu/images/Colors-NameRGBhexValues.jpg"
  alt= "examples of the rgb hexadecimal and decimals codes">
  <p> well im gonna end this sesh here, ill probably watch a vid before work till then, signing off :)</p>
 <h2 class="heading-shit">hey im back</h2>
 <p id="zoo-wee-mama">its my day off so hopefully i'd get some more work done than usual, learned how to style individual parts so i'm gonna try to color this paragraph.</p>

<h2 class="heading-shit">i have learned about class</h2>
<p class="class-commentary"> its when i can style shit in specific groups</p>
<p class="class-commentary">For CSS, im starting to understand the different attributes</p>
<p class="class-commentary"> and the diffrent ways you have to start a selector for the css rule</p>
<p class="class-commentary">but the second half of it is the same thing each time which is givin it a name and make sure its spelled right, all lowercase, and no spaces only hyphens and underscores</p>
<p class="class-commentary"> now back to the class thing, im gonna color this whole group now.</p>
<h2 class="heading-shit"> Maybe I should start putting dates on each session? Anywho it's 5/17'</h2>
<h2>session 5/19</h2>
<p> i didnt write down anything from last time <strong>buut</strong> i did learn some things; i learned how to make links. I'll get some experiments in on this sesh this evening </p>
<h2 id="chapter-four"> okay this whole datin the entries thing is a bit stupid now so I'm not doin that anymore, <em>anyways</em>...</h2>
<p> Finished my notes on how to make links on a webpage so imma give that a go now </p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/rmendez202/clothes/">

<p> And as you can see on the top, I learned how to make a table of contents. which is a mixture of <strong><em>making lists</em></strong> and <strong><em>adding links</em></strong> so it was a piece of cake not going to write notes on that since its basically a combo of the shit I already learned</p>

<h2>Learned how to make <em>tables</em> so im gonna do one of my family's animal kingdom </h2>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Species</th>
      <th>Color</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Chloe</td>
          <td>Dog</td>
          <td>Blonde</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>Lucy</td>
          <td>Dog</td>
          <td>White</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>Bella</td>
          <td>Cat</td>
          <td>Black & White</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>HeiHei</td>
          <td>Rabbit</td>
          <td>White & Brown</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody>
          </table>
<p> Tables was pretty easy to learn, I just learned the tags needed for it and how to put it together. Its a fuck ton of tags so I wrote them all down includin the formula to make the table</p>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<!--so i learned how to make comments. You wont see it on the webpage because its something for other humans to see, not the browser.-->
<h2 id="chapter-five">Lots of Font Shit for Css</h2>
<p class="font-intro">A whole segment on khan is about fonts for CSS, so i'll be doing diffrent fonts throughout this part.</p>
<p class="font-intro">I have a feeling i wont be needing to memorize all the text properties, I'm sure theres different websites I can check out to pick different ones...and im right <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference">here it is</a></p>
<p>one example for the text properties is font familiy. Dont stress about remembering them all i'll just put them all in a list here</p>
<ul>
 <li id="serif" class="font-ex">serif</li>
 <li id="sans-serif" class="font-ex">sans-serif</li>
 <li id="monospace" class="font-ex">monospace</li>
 <li id="cursive" class="font-ex"> cursive</li>
 <li id="fantasy" class="font-ex">fantasy</li>
 <li id="system-ui" class="font-ex">system-ui</li>
 <li id="ui-serif" class="font-ex">ui-serif</li>
 <li id="ui-sans-serif" class="font-ex">ui-sans-serif</li>
 <li id="ui-monospace" class="font-ex">ui-monospace</li>
 <li id="ui-rounded" class="font-ex">ui-rounded</li>
 <li id="emoji" class="font-ex">emoji</li>
 <li id="math" class="font-ex">math</li>
 <li id="fangsong" class="font-ex">fangsong</li>
 <p>Theres a lot of text properties that i'll learn over time so dont forget to experiment and mess around on there' </p>
